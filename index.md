## News
 - August 18<sup>th</sup> 2022: Deadline extension 
 - June 8<sup>th</sup> 2022: [Call for papers for CODAI'22 workshop](assets/documents/codai22_cfp.pdf) published
 - May 12<sup>th</sup> 2022: CODAI has been accepted at **Embedded Systems Week 2022**

## Overview

**CODAI'22** is an  [Embedded Systems Week](https://esweek.org/ ) workshop to coalesce the emerging energy in the AI compiler communities and AI accelerator communities focusing on Edge AI in both academic and industrial research. These realms of research have the opportunity to deliver a pervasive and seamless end-to-end tooling that connects hardware and software development methodologies. This workshop mainly focuses on:
 - Discussing new impulses for deployment of Neural Networks on low-end embedded systems
 - Cooperative development of (open source) toolchains/frameworks for neural network deployment + cooperation between industry and academia
 
Therefore, it **complements the established conferences** CASES and CODES+ISSS which have a wider and more academic research-spectrum. 
We also welcome work-in-progress papers of ongoing research projects and case studies from industrial applications.

Topics for workshop submissions include, but are not limited to:

 - Optimization techniques of neural networks on embedded edge systems: **compression, pruning, quantization techniques,
  hardware/compiler-aware neural architecture search**, etc.
 - Performance estimation of neural networks on embedded systems: **virtual prototyping, surrogate modeling, profiling** etc.
 - Compilers for Edge AI: **partitioning, mapping, retargeting, intermediate representations, 
   for heterogeneous systems and architectures, µC, DSP** etc.
 - Code-generation and compiler-backends for AI accelerators - especially for **RISC-V**
  and **beyond-von-Neumann AI accelerators** is appreciated
 - Applications: processing of **embedded vision, sensor signal processing, novel brain-inspired algorithms for Edge AI** etc.

**CODAI'22** will take place on *October 13<sup>th</sup> 2022* as virtual workshop.

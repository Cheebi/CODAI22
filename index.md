# CODAI’22: Workshop on Compilers Deployment, and Tooling for Embedded AI 
![CODAI Logo](/assets/images/logo.png)
## at Embedded Systems Week ’22

The goal of the CODAI workshop is to coalesce the emerging energy in the AI compiler communities and
AI accelerator communities focusing on Embedded AI in both academic and industrial research. These
realms of research have the opportunity to deliver a pervasive and seamless end-to-end tooling that
connects hardware and software development methodologies. This workshop mainly focus on:
* Discussing new impulses for deployment of Neural Networks on low-end embedded systems
* Cooperative development of (open-source) toolchains/frameworks for neural network
deployment + cooperation between industry and academia

Therefore, it complements the established conferences CASES and CODES+ISSS which have a wider and
more academic research-spectrum. We also welcome work-in-progress papers of ongoing research
projects and case studies from industrial applications.

Topics for workshop submissions include, but are not limited to:
* Optimization techniques and performance estimation of neural networks on embedded systems: e.g. compression, quantization techniques, Virtual Prototyping
* Compilers for Embedded AI: Partitioning, μC, heterogeneous systems, intermediate representations or (domain specific) languages
* Code-Generation and hardware-backends for AI accelerators - especially RISC-V appreciated
* Applications: Processing of embedded vision, time-series data, etc
* Novel brain-inspired algorithm for Edge-AI
* Compiler and optimization techniques for beyond-von-Neumann AI accelerators
